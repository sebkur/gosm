INSTALLATION

Currently, you can just compile everything and use the software.
To compile, enter:

make

gcc will then build a binary named 'gosm' in the src-directory
This file can be executed from this dir by launching 

./gosm

from this directory or from every other path, too.

REQUIREMENTS

The following libraries are required for running/building gosm.
I'm not sure about minimal version numbers, so that I'll just tell
which ones I'm using:

for RUNNING gosm you'll need:

libglib2.0-0                            2.20.1-1
