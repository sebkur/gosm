<h3 align="left">What are the ideas about Gosm?</h3>
<h4 align="left">Support for different Map-Tiles</h4>
<p align="left">
It should be possible to show other map-tiles instead of the default OpenStreetMap ones. Generally this is no problem from the software-engeneering side, but terms-of-use of providers may conflict with the ability of gosm to produce images of concatenations of multiple tiles to large images.
<br /><br />
e.g. what do the terms-of-use of Google or Yahoo say about this? Tell me.

<h4 align="left">Add functionality for starting a custom renderer</h4>
<p align="left">
There are nice tools out there, that are able to produce custom maps from pure map-data, i.e. the data provided by the OpenStreetMap-project by their API for retrieving the data collected in the project. Theese tools usually need the coordinates of the area to render and some information on how the resulting map should look like. It'd be nice, if such a renderer could be feed with the selection made in gosm.

<h4 align="left">Custom maps based on existing rendered tiles</h4>
<p align="left">
Sometimes it seems a bit exaggerated to render the complete area to produce a custom map. Then it might be useful to put markers on the area, that should be drawn on an exported map.
