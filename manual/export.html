Once an area has been selected on the map, you can click the 'export image'-button on the sidebar to export an image of the selection. You will be able to select the zoomlevel to use for the export.<br /><br />
<b>Note:</b> you have to download the tiles of the desired zoomlevels before exporting to an image, since the exporting algorithm doesn't download itself. Non-existing tiles will be replaced by white areas on the resulting image.<br /><br />
<b>Note:</b> currently the exporting is done in the main thread. The application will block until the image is ready.
