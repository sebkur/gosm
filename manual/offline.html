<p align="left">
Gosm usually saves loaded tiles in '/tmp/osm/'. Since they are saved in a subdirectory of '/tmp', they will propably be deleted on next system startup.<br /><br />
To make them available for offline browsing for longer times, go to the preferences-dialog and set a different path for the 'cache_dir'-entry.<br /><br />
You can even make whole areas available for offline browsing by selecting an area and on the map and clicking the 'load to disk'-button on the sidebar. Then select the desired zoomlevels you would like to make available and go ahead.
